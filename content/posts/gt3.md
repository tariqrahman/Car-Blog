## Introduction

As the automotive scene shifts to an era in which autonomy and sustainability rule consumerism, the scope of tasteful modern production vehicles has diminished. Ironically, Porsche refuses to take their foot off the gas, producing yet another immaculate generation of the 911 GT3. In the remainder of this post, we'll seek to determine whether the 992 GT3 lives up to the fame of its predeccesors. 

## Specifications

Check out some general data detailing key differences between the 991 & 992 GT3:

| Stat Type &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    | 991 GT3  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     | 992 GT3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Horsepower   | 476           | 502 hp      |
| Torque       | 324 lb-ft     | 346 lb-ft   |
| 0-60 mph     | 3.4s          | 3.2s        |
| 1/4 Mile     | 11.2 s        | 10.9s       |
| Top Speed    | 196 mph       | 197 mph     |


For reference, 991 statistics are based on the 2016-2019 facelift version of the GT3.


## Features

No, the 992 GT3 wasn't built shatter records on the track. Instead, its simply an accessory. Numerous modifications to various aspects of the vehicle led to a marginal 18-second improvement in lap time around the NÃ¼rburgring compared to its predeccesor. 

How is this possible?

Firstly, weight reduction. While minute, new spec options allow buyers to reconfigure the roof, front hood, and rear panels to carbon-fiber reduced plastic. Porsche also opted to emphasize performance over luxury slightly more than previous generations, effectively eliminating cabin sound-deadning materials completely. On top of this, electing the manual gearbox over the paddle-shift-driven PDK transmission shaves another 37.5lbs off to net a 3126lb total. 

Now, the good stuff. Rather than sticking to the 3.0-liter engine running the regular 911 line, the GT3 sports a 4.0-liter NA flat-six revving upwards of a 9,000 rpm redline (though the dial teases a sexier 10,000). Tying the ribbon is the notorious 6-speed manual gearbox, landing 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds. Though not as quick as the 2.7 second sprint in PDK model, the manual gearbox represents a staple in the Porsche community, making it hard to pass up. Check out [Ezra Dyer's Review](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a39729350/2022-porsche-911-gt3-manual-by-the-numbers/) for a firsthand perspective on both transmission options.

## Pros / Cons

Given I can't take this beauty for a spin myself, I'll refer to MotorTrend's review for a more detailed Pro / Con list.

| Pros                               | Cons                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Impeccable Handling |     Somewhat Overkill For Street Driving        |
| World Class Engine + Transmission Combination | Suspect Ride Quality  |
| Music To My Ears                   | Absurd Markup Pricing            |
## Personal Take

As a college student, my only experience behind the wheel of a GT3 lies in my dreams. Still, the announcment for this generation caught my eye more than any competitor of its class. The subtle yet distinct changes to the classic chassy perfectly transition into the more sharp body lines of the modern automobile era. Though many prefer the subtle look of the touring rear, the statement made by the flashy spoiler make it known that Porsche doens't reserve super car performance and aesthetic solely for the RS. And of course, Porsche's notoriety for producing top tier handling goes without saying. Despite this being a bucket list car for myself, my review lines up nearly identically with those of professional automotive critics who pride themselves on objectivity. Whether or not you buy the praise, don't waste your time spec-ing one out. If you can get past the lengthy waitlist, you'll be stuck stuck dropping an extra $100k in markup value alone.
