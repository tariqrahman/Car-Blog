## Introduction

As the automotive scene shifts to an era in which autonomy and sustainability rule consumerism, the scope of tasteful modern production vehicles has diminished. Ironically, Porsche refuses to take their foot off the gas, producing yet another immaculate generation of the 911 GT3. In the remainder of this post, we'll seek to determine whether the 992 GT3 lives up to the fame of its predeccesors. 

## Statistics / Data

Check out some general data detailing key differences between the 991 & 992 GT3:
